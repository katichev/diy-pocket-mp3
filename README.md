# Diy SD/MMC mp3 player based on VS1001k and PIC16F73

This repo contains source code and schematics of diy MP3 player which was originally released for the first time more than 10 years ago. I don't think someone will ever try to made it again. 

Originally this project used to live at mp3vkarmane.nm.ru, it is still available through [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20060202005207/http://mp3vkarmane.nm.ru/) (Russian!).
